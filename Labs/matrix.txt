Exercise 1 _
Create three vectors  x,y,z  with integers and each vector has 3 elements. Combine the three vectors to become a 3×3 matrix  A  where each column represents a vector. Change the row names to  a,b,c. _

Exercise 2 _
Please check your result from Exercise 1, using  is.matrix(A). It should return  TRUE, if your answer is correct. _

Exercise 3 _
Create a vector with 12 integers. Convert the vector to a 4*3 matrix  B  using  matrix(). Please change the column names to  x, y, z  and row names to  a, b, c, d. _
The argument  byrow  in  matrix()  is set to be  FALSE  by default. Please change it to  TRUE  and print  B  to see the differences.
