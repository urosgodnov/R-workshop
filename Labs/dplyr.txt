Use mtcars.

Exercise 1
Print out the hp column using the select() function. 

Exercise 2
Print out all but the hp column using the select() function.

Exercise 3
Print out the mpg, hp, vs, am, gear columns. Consider using the colon : symbol to simplfy selection of consecutive columns.

Exercise 4
Create a new variable in the mycars data frame km_per_litre using the mutate() function. Hint: 1 mpg is 0.425 km/l.

Exercise 5
Randomly select and print half the observations of mycars and store it into mycars_s. Hint: consider using the sample_frac() function

Exercise 6
Print out the mycars_s object without any duplicates. Hint: Consider using the distinct() function.

Exercise 7
Print out from mycars_s object all the observations which have mpg>20 and hp>100.

Excercise 8
Transform all columns from original mtcars to character. Consider using mutate_all. If you have dplyr1.0.0 try using mutate+across.

Excercise 9
Display mtcars mean and median for mpg, hp and consumption.

Excercise 10
Identify the worst and best economic car.
